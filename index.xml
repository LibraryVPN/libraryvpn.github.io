      <description>People are increasingly concerned by attacks on their online security and privacy. Those who cannot afford broadband access in their home have to rely on free public wifi hotspots where security can be minimal and there are no built in security or privacy protection. Even those who can afford their own internet service have reason to worry about applications abusing their access to gather information and sell it for profit.</description>

      <description>LibraryVPN is an IMLS funded project. It is being developed by a partnership of libraries including the Lebanon Public Libraries, the Westchester Library System, and the Cherry hill Public Library working with LEAP. This software is free and opensource, so anyone who wishes to can install it and run it free of charge. We are currently investigated the possibility of a hosted version of this software for libraries that wish to use it, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to host it for themselves.</description>
