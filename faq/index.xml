      <title>Why Do We Need a Vpn? Isn&#39;t Https Enough?</title>

      <description>HTTPS is very important for security. It provides end to end encryption of your content. You can think of this like an envelope on a letter. Unlike a postcard (http), people can no longer read the contents, but they can still find out lots of information (metadata) such as who is sending the information, who they are sending it to, and how much the two are talking.
In contrast, a VPN provides an encrypted tunnel that all the web traffic passes through.</description>

      <title>Will Everyone on the Library Network Use the VPN?</title>

      <description>No, your existing library network will not be affected. Only people who choose to connect through the VPN client will use the VPN.</description>

      <title>Can We Run LibraryVPN if We Do Not Have IT Staff?</title>

      <description>We would not recommend hosting LibraryVPN without dedicated IT staff. However we are hoping to have a hosted version available in the future so that all libraries can take advantage of their software to protect their patron&amp;rsquo;s privacy.</description>

      <title>What Are Potential Risks to running LibraryVPN?</title>

      <description>If you are self-hosting LibraryVPN you should be aware that anything a patron does while connected to the VPN will appear to come from your IP address. This is already the case when patrons use a libraries public internet or WIFI so this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too big of a change for libraries. Like when patrons use the public wifi available within the library, they may decide to do bad things while using the library&amp;rsquo;s VPN connection.</description>

      <description>LibraryVPN is an IMLS funded project. It is being developed by a partnership of libraries including the Lebanon Public Libraries, the Westchester Library System, and the Cherry hill Public Library working with LEAP. This software is free and opensource, so anyone who wishes to can install it and run it free of charge. We are currently investigated the possibility of a hosted version of this software for libraries that wish to use it, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to host it for themselves.</description>
