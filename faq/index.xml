      <description>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect your online traffic by creating a private tunnel between your computer and a VPN server. The internet traffic appears to orginate at the VPN server, and all that anyone who is sniffing network traffic can see is the encrypted connection. This helps those who are traveling, who are using public WIFI, or who want to avoid surveillance from their Internet Service Provider. Many mainstream sources such as the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Wall Street Journal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation all agree that using a VPN is an important part of maintaining privacy and security on the internet today.</description>

      <title>What Is Wrong With Current VPN Offerings?</title>

      <description>There are several problems with current VPN offerings.
First, all reliable VPN solutions require a monthly fee. This puts them out of reach of those who are most vulnerable to exploitation. They are already in the position of using publicly available internet connections which puts their security and privacy at risk, and because of their financial circumstances they cannot take advantage of the technology which can protect them.
The second problem is that using a VPN requires people to place their trust in whatever VPN company they use.</description>

      <description>Library VPN brings together two ideas that are both widely accepted in modern library practice. 1. Libraries should work to protect patron privacy 2. Libraries host online services for their patrons
Libraries have long worked to protect patron privacy. Librarian sometimes refer to this as the &amp;ldquo;Freedom to Read&amp;rdquo;, but this extends far beyond physical books. We care about people being able to exercise their intellectual freedom when accessing information, regardless of the form that information takes.</description>

      <description>We would not recommend hosting LibraryVPN without dedicated IT staff. However we are hoping to have a hosted version available in the future so that all libraries can take advantage of their software to protect their patron&amp;rsquo;s privacy.</description>

      <title>What Are Potential Risks to running LibraryVPN?</title>

      <description>If you are self-hosting LibraryVPN you should be aware that anything a patron does while connected to the VPN will appear to come from your IP address. This is already the case when patrons use a libraries public internet or WIFI so this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too big of a change for libraries. Like when patrons use the public wifi available within the library, they may decide to do bad things while using the library&amp;rsquo;s VPN connection.</description>

      <description>LibraryVPN is an IMLS funded project. It is being developed by a partnership of libraries including the Lebanon Public Libraries, the Westchester Library System, and the Cherry hill Public Library working with LEAP. This software is free and opensource, so anyone who wishes to can install it and run it free of charge. We are currently investigated the possibility of a hosted version of this software for libraries that wish to use it, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to host it for themselves.</description>
